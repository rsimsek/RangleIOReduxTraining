Rangle.io React online training Part 2 - Redux
I would like to thank RANGLE.IO(https://rangle.io/) for their amazing free React courses. It is a fantastic training which helps understanding everything about React ecosystem. 

This is a training course for developers looking to learn React. It is a part 1 of a 3 part seriese for learning the entire React+Redux ecosystem to create production ready apps. 

To run the project:

1. Clone the repo

2. `npm install`

3. `npm start`

webpack will compile all of the code in the src/ folder. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
